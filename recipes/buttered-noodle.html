        <h1>Buttered noodles</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package fettuccine noodles</li>

                <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
